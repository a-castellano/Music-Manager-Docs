## Purpose

The aim of this project is to help me in order to manage my music collection.

Also, I want to split this project in different microsrvices in order to improve my knowledge about them and microsrvices architecture.

## Service Intercomunication

The following graph shows how microservices are communicated.

User -- Asks for an artist, album or pendent job --> Request_Manager[Request Manager];
Request_Manager -- Request info if job has finished --> Storage_Manager[Storage Manager];
Request_Manager -- Asks for job satus --> Status_Manager[Status Manager];
Storage_Manager -- Check for requested info --> MusicInfoStore[(Music Info Store)];

Request_Manager -- No job found, create a job --> Job_Manager[Job Manager];
Job_Manager -- Store pendent job ID --> Status_Manager;
Status_Manager -- Store job ID with pending status --> JobStatusStore[(Job Status Store)];
Status_Manager -- Update job with finished status --> JobStatusStore[(Job Status Store)];
Status_Manager -- Check job status --> JobStatusStore[(Job Status Store)];

Job_Manager -- Send new job --> Job_Router[Job Router];
Job_Router -- Route job --> Metal_Archives_Wrapper[Metal archives wrapper];
Metal_Archives_Wrapper -- Retrieve info --> Metal_Archives((metal-archives));
Metal_Archives_Wrapper -- Returns retrieved info--> Job_Router;
Job_Router -- Not found at metal archives - Look for info --> Music_Brainz_Wrapper[Music Brainz wrapper];
Music_Brainz_Wrapper -- Retrieve info --> Music_Brainz((musicbrainz));
Music_Brainz_Wrapper -- Returns retrieved info --> Job_Router;
Job_Router -- Job has finished  - Send retrieved info to be stored --> Storage_Manager;
Job_Router -- Job has finished  - Send job final status to be stored --> Status_Manager;
Storage_Manager[Storage Manager] -- Store retrieved info --> MusicInfoStore[(Music Info Store)];
